# EJS-Blog

Some EJS practical from Angela Yu's Udemy Web Dev Course.

EJS-Blog is a web app that allows you no create posts like you do in a Blog an show them in your home page.

I have used express.js and lodash's library, so I could use the lowerCase method to set a new page for every single post generated by the "/compose" link.

It was a great opportunity to apply some of the EJS templating to generate dinamic pages.

I had succed in this challange all by myself using the knoledge I got in the previews modules, with no other hints, but google research.

I also personalized the code after finishing using some CSS and Bootstrap.
